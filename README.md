# gitz
Gitz is a programming language that embraces broken English while still being readable and functional. Gitz is designed to be fun, expressive and intuitive. Gitz is designed to so that people can write code as if they were talking, but it still compiles

Gitz is perfect for those who think programming should have more personality. If python is readable, Gitz is vibable

## Features

- **Print, but Casual:** No need for `print()`. Just use `say()`.
- **Variables? Just Make Up Words:** You don't need `let` or `var`. Just name it.
- **Loops:** Use `loopuntil` instead of `while`.
- **Functions:** Define functions with `youDo()`.
- **If-Else:** Gitz handles conditions with `ifMaybe()` and `elseNo()`.
- **Lists:** Gitz supports lists using `bunch`.
- **No Static Typing:** But we do check your logic.
